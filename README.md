# MemoryGame

Second JavaScript project 

Game is done, but I need to add more to the css to make it pretty.

Other things to add:
  * Running total of how many wrong clicks.
  * Percent correct?
  * Play again button
  * Another set of images
  * Random set selector or click a button to select set?
